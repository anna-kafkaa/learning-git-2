    <h1>Taarlo</h1>
    <p>
      We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br />
      And in spring too I feel no different.<br />
      We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br />
      through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br />
      We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br />
      Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br />
      sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br />
      of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br />
      at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br />
      The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br />
      The here is nowhere, and the now is never.
